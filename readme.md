# MouseList
App created for the scientists team working with mice. Serves as an interface and filter for the database, where different kind of informations are being stored:
- Information about undergoing procedures and experiments;
- Daily data gathered about animals being worked on.

# MouseListModerator
App for setting up the database for each project. The moderator / Lab manager is able to define relationships and dependencies between the data, which is assigned later on by users.

## About

Data stored in database can be easily reached for making reports and data analysis.
This application, together with the separate program for the lab manager and database replace the previous Excel Scoresheets, which were too complicated, confusing and above all exposed to input-mistakes and mishaps.

This is my first programm created for "outer world"; the app is being used since september 2020 and is continuously being worked on and fixed - as I am still learning new things and being more aware of things that weren't done ideally or things that can be improved.
